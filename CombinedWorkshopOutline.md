#Three Areas:

Knowledge
  - What do we know already as individuals and as a group to accelerate the goals of the project.
  - E.g. if we have programming experience, we can move forward quickly. Otherwise we will spend time in the Mindset piece.
  - Very miniscule (Cataloguing of existing knowledge in the room) - 2 hour session.

Mindset
  - Evaluation of what exists. Trying to shift from what exists to what you want to create.
  - 1/3 of total time. Integrated throughought the course.

Skill
  - Rapid prototyping; adapting existing things to fulfil new needs
  - Training of skills in a collaborative, hands-on way.
