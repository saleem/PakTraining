#Purpose of workshop
Learn the process of creating educational software from a holistic perspective.

#Abstract
This is a 5-day workshop and its purpose is to provide broad insights to the design of educational software. The primary target audience are the faculty and students of MS in Innovative Technologies in Education at NUST.

The content of the workshop (defined below) is broad and interdisciplinary; drawing its theoretical basis from Education, Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science. However, the workshop is very much hands-on and practice-focused; making it suitable for students and faculty from other departments and degree programs within NUST.

We recommend the workshop be scheduled during the summer break. This helps the attendees: they can put the learning from this workshop in practice in the fall semester.

#Outline

The workshop will be five days long and will include collaborative sessions on the following topics:

## Day 0: (before the workshop)
Before the workshop, the participants will be asked to complete a brief (10-15 minutes) survey. 

Facilitators will use this survey to work with the individual needs and contexts of the paricipants. 

## Day 1:

* Hopes and concerns - what are the collective aspirations of the attendees regarding the workshop. 
* Engines and anchors - discover things that empower us and those that inhibit us from accomplishing our goals.
* Estabilishing a Vision - establish a clear perspective and scope for our product

## Day 2:

* Process and product - what is the difference, and what is the siginificance of each.
* Requirements - learning how to express software requirements that can be delivered in small increments.
* Buy vs build - learn the pros and cons of using pre-designed software and custom-written software

## Day 3:

* User personas - learn how to think about and represent end-users of our software as real people with real needs.
* Estimation - learn how to assign numerical estimates to software requirements
* Cross-cutting concerns - learning about aspects of software that aren't directly related to user requirements.

## Day 4

* Planning and prioritization - Learning how to triage amongst potentially unlimited requirements and practical resource constraints
* Establishing cadence and continuity - how to enable software delivery teams to work independently and share continuously the outcome of their work.
* Ensuring Quality in software - learn about the "who, what and when" of ensuring software meets quality requirements

## Day 5

* Technical considerations - continuous delivery, automation, testing.
* Retrospective of the workshop

#What makes this workshop unique
This workshopd draws on Cross-disciplinary / inter-disciplinary learning combining Eduction and Computer Science.

This is timely and necessary for the attendees.

The workshop facilitators have experience in offering similar content in other settings in both developed and developed countries.

#Outcomes of workshop

* Learn practical techniques to design better educational software
* Acquire an appreciation for how to tackle the complexity of building software
* Adopt best practices for understanding and meeting the needs of users  

#Three Focus Areas:

Knowledge

* Catologuing: Examine what know already as individuals and as a group to accelerate the goals of the workshop project. 
* Adopting/Adapting: Best practices that may challenge and push our thinking about interdeisplinary program experiences.

Mindset

* Assessment: Invesitigate what we understand to exist in programming and the educational software world. 
* Development: Try to shift from what exists to what you want to create.
  - 1/3 of total time. Integrated throughought the course.

Skill

*Rapid prototyping; adapting existing things to fulfil new needs
*Training of skills in a collaborative, hands-on way.
