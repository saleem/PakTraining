# Lean and Agile Software Development - a hands-on workshop

This document describes a propsed workshop offered by Saleem Siddiqui for software professionals and students at National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad.


# Goal
To learn how to deliver working software that solves a specific problem in the business, academic or social sector.


# Duration
Ten work-days, ideally over a two-week period. Each day will involve 7-8 hours of activity.


# Number of attendees
A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 20 attendees.


# Who may attend
Individuals who have a professional interest in and some experience of delivering software are encouraged to attend. Please see the [Sample Profiles](#profiles) below to determine if you'll benefit from this workshop.

# Course Outline

This is a broad outline of how the ten-day workshop will be structured.

| | Morning | Afternoon | 
| ------------ | ------------- 
| **Day 1** | Intro to Lean and Agile software development | Requirements and planning | 
| **Day 2** |Stories and estimation | Pairing and collaboration |
| **Day 3** |Continuous integration and testing | Incremental code development |
| **Day 4** |Project selection | Project Inception, part 1 |
| **Day 5** |Project Inception, part 2 | Infrastructure  |
| **Days 6 - 9** |Project work | Project work |
| **Day 10** |Final project showcase | Celebrating and continuing success |

The first three days comprise training in an interactive classroom setup. Attendees will learn by listening to brief descriptions of techniques and will spend the majority of the time practicing those techniques by themselves and in small groups.

The next seven days will revolve around actual software delivery on a project that will be chosen collaboratively by all the attendees. The entire group will work as a _real_ team -- defining, designing, testing and delivering the software to solve a real (albeit manageable)
problem.


# Techniques, technologies and frameworks

A variety of software techniques, tools, libraries and frameworks will be used during the training. To simplify software delivery, there will be a strong emphasis on using Open Source tools and frameworks. Some tools that may be used include:

1. Java language and platform. Frameworks such as Play, JUnit, Mockito, JBehave, etc.
2. Ruby language. Frameworks such as Rails, Cucumber, Rspec, etc.
3. Continuous Integration tools such as Go or Jenkins.


# Logistical, hardware and software requirements
 
 The following supplies and logistical arrangements will need to be procured for the workshop:
 
 1. A room spacious enough to accomodate the attendees (10 - 20) and the facilitator.
 2. Sturdy tables and comfortable chairs, preferably the kind that can be moved around to allow different seating configurations.
 3. Development-capable computers or laptops for the attendees. One computer for every two attendees will be sufficient. That is: if there are 20 attendees, we will need 10 computers.
 4. Reliable and sufficiently high-speed internet connection for all computers.
 5. Flip-charts, markers, white/black board, writing supplies, etc.

**Education:** Finished B.Sc. and B.E. in Chemical Engineering. Learned software programming on his own and through online courses.

**Interests:** Improving his programming skills so that he can teach others.

**Style of learning:** Likes to learn by himself by trying things out. Finds it difficult to work in large groups, but is willing to learn how to write software collaboratively.

**Education:** Second year student (sophomore), B.E. in Computer Science.

**Interests:** Learning new programming languages, baking, singing (and occasionally composing her own songs).

**Prefered Style of learning:** Likes to try things out -- whether it's creating software, cakes or lyrics. Likes to discuss things with people rather than reading academic articles.
